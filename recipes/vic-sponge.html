    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a great cake that I will make for my brother's birthday. It's our favourite cake. When I was growing up, my mom used to make this cake and bring it to school for me to celebrate my birthday with my friends.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>200g caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>200g self praising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100-150g strawberry jam</li>
        <li>100ml double cream</li>
        <li>handful of fresh strawberrries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / 350°F / Gas 4. Grease and line two 8-inch (20cm) round cake tins.</li>
        <li>Cream together 200g butter and 200g sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the 4 eggs, one at a time. Fold in 200g self-raising flour and 1 tsp baking powder (plus vanilla & milk if using) until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the tins and smooth the tops. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden and springy to the touch. Let them cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Once completely cool, spread jam on one sponge. Top with whipped cream or buttercream, then sandwich the second sponge on top.</li>
